# movie-recommender-system-tmdb-5000-data
 ## Project Overview:

Built a content-based movie recommender system using the TMDB 5000 movie dataset.
Leveraged cosine similarity to recommend movies based on content features such as genres, keywords, cast, and overviews.
Key Features:

## Text Vectorization:

Utilized TF-IDF to convert movie overviews into numerical vectors.
## Cosine Similarity:

Calculated cosine similarity between movie vectors to measure content similarity.
## TMDB API Integration:

Integrated with the TMDB API to fetch additional information for movies, including images, videos, and overviews.
Streamlit User Interface:

Developed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
Users can input a movie title and receive recommendations with posters, videos, and overviews.
## Deployment:

Deployed the recommender system for public access using platforms like Streamlit Sharing or Heroku.
User Interaction:

Users can interact with the app by inputting a movie title or selecting from a predefined list.
Options for adjusting parameters or filters enhance the user experience.
## Code Structure:

Organized the code into modular components for readability and maintainability.
Included comments for key parts of the code.
## Testing and Validation:

Conducted testing with various input scenarios to ensure accurate and relevant recommendations.
Validated recommendations against user expectations.
## Visualization:

Incorporated visual elements such as movie posters and embedded videos within the Streamlit app for an enhanced user experience.
